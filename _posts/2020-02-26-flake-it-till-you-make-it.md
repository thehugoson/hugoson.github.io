BFS (Breadth-First Search) is an algorithm that explores vertices of a graph in the order of breadth-first. It starts from a certain vertex and explores its neighbors before moving on to their neighbors. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of vertices in the order they are visited. Because BFS explores the neighbors of a vertex before moving on to their neighbors, it ensures that vertices at shorter distance are visited before vertices at longer distance. It can be useful in cases such as finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, finding the level of a vertex in a graph, and finding the shortest path in a maze.
