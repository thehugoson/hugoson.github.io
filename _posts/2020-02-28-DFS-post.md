DFS (Depth-First Search) is an algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts from a certain vertex, explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking to explore other branches. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of vertices in the current branch of exploration. It goes as deep as possible before backtracking. It can be useful in cases such as solving problems that involve finding paths in a graph, exploring all vertices and edges in a graph, searching for a specific target vertex, and determining the connectivity of a graph.
